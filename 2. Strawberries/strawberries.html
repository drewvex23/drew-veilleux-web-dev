            <p class="conditions">Basic considerations when locating a strawberry path include:</p>

            <ul class="condition-list">
                <li>Full sun</li>
                <li>Well drained, sandy loam with a soil pH from 5.8 to 6.2 is ideal</li>
                <li>Don't plant where tomatoes, potatoes, pepers or eggplant have grown recently</li>

            </ul>

            <p class="plant-instructions">Start with a rich, organic soil. Apply a balanced fertilizer (10-10-10) at planting at the rate of one pound per 100 sq. ft. Fertilize again after renovation of June bearers or second harvest of day neutrals and everbeaming types. Do not ever fertilizer or you will have excessive leaf growth or poor flowering. Do not fertilizer strawberries late in the season in colder climate to prevent new growth that will be damaged by frost.</p>
